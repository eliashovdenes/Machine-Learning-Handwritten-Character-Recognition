My approach

Data Preprocessing:


Classifier Training:

Start with SVM or Random Forest using class_weight='balanced'.
If needed, apply oversampling (SMOTE) and retrain with reduced class weights.
Evaluation:

Focus on metrics like Precision, Recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC for better evaluation of minority class performance.
Plot the confusion matrix to understand specific misclassifications.
Consider CNNs (Optional):

If accuracy is crucial and computation resources are available, 
using CNN would likely yield the best results, especially for handwritten digit recognition tasks.
